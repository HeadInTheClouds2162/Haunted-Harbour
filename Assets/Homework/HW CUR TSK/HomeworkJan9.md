# Homework 2026-01-09 --> 2026-01-16


## OBJECTIVE:

The player should be able to PRESS E, and delete ANY gameObject that is directly in front them.

## SETUP (MANDATORY STEPS):

1. Right click in the project tab and create a new scene named MYNAME_TestingScene
2. Create a floor, and drag in the player object from the prefabs folder.
3. Create a new script in your homework folder (Feel free to add more folders too) labelled "MYNAME_InteractionController"
4. Attach your script to the player object.

## BONUS:

The item should not delete, but rather be equipped, and once the player presses E again the item should be thrown.

So, E to pick up, E again to throw.

How you throw it is up to you, BONUS BONUS if when you throw it goes to the mouse position

## RULES:

* ___YOU MUST ONLY CREATE NEW CODE IN SCRIPTS YOU CREATED FOR THIS ASSIGNMENT___
* No viewing other students code, or asking other classmates for help in this assignment
* AI and Videos are entirely permitted, use the internet to your advantage
* You may reach out and ask for help, but give it a solid attempt before reaching out

## HINTS:

* Go look in PlayerMovement for how we did input
* You must implement an interface to do new controls.
* Go look in GroundingController for how we do raycasting
* The total final code should be 5 - 15 lines, up to 30 if you do the bonus. Obviously use more if you have to. Getting it to work is more important than being stylish or optimized

## ADDTIONAL NOTES:
I've already created a key bind for Interact (E). It's important you know how to make new ones, but you can just use the one I made for this taks.
